      The STRATI Congress has long served as a premier platform for
      stratigraphic research, with its legacy rooted in Europe. As the event’s
      global influence continues to expand, particularly within China’s thriving
      stratigraphic community, hosting the next congress in Suzhou, China,
      represents a historic milestone for the International Commission on
      Stratigraphy (ICS). This decision not only amplifies STRATI’s worldwide
      reach but also celebrates China’s pivotal contributions to stratigraphy
      and its enduring collaboration with the ICS.

      China boasts a rich variety of geological strata and fossils, showcasing
      its status as a treasure trove of paleontological resources. In this era
      of big data and artificial intelligence (AI), China has emerged as an
      active member in integrating cutting-edge technologies with stratigraphic
      research. With the largest cohort of stratigraphers globally, Chinese
      scientists are pioneering new paradigms—leveraging machine learning to
      analyze vast geological datasets, reconstruct deep-time environments, and
      refine global chronostratigraphic frameworks. Their work is supported by
      big data platforms, which exemplifies China’s commitment to open data and
      collaborative innovation.

      The Chinese stratigraphy community and the Jiangsu Provincial Government
      are fully dedicated to ensuring the success of the STRATI 2026 Congress in
      Suzhou. This congress will spotlight transformative approaches in
      stratigraphy, including AI-driven correlation methods, high-resolution
      geochronology, and data-driven paleoenvironmental modeling. Suzhou, a
      picturesque city renowned for its classical gardens and harmonious blend
      of heritage and innovation, offers an inspiring backdrop for this global
      event. As the headquarters of the Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE)
      Program—the first International Union of Geological Sciences
      (IUGS)-endorsed Big Science Initiative—the Suzhou DDE Center will provide
      robust logistical support and showcase its advancements in stratigraphy
      and big data integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      We envision this congress as a platform to bridge tradition and
      technology. In a spirit of openness and collaboration, we warmly invite
      the global stratigraphy community to join us in Suzhou. All subcommissions
      and communities will have the possibility to organize scientific sessions
      over the course of the six-day event. The program will be completed by
      pre-, mid- and post-conference field excursions. Together, we will explore
      how stratigraphy enhances global correlations, and unlock new insights
      into Earth’s dynamic history. We look forward to welcoming you to this
      exciting gathering of global experts!
