      The STRATI Congress has long served as a cornerstone of international stratigraphic research, fostering dialogue and innovation across continents with a legacy rooted in Europe. As Earth science challenges and opportunities become increasingly interconnected, STRATI 2026 represents a pivotal opportunity to enhance global cooperation. Hosting this edition in Suzhou reflects the International Commission on Stratigraphy’s (ICS) dedication to promoting inclusive worldwide scientific exchange and addressing shared priorities in stratigraphic research.
    </p>
    <p>
      This congress comes at a critical time for the Earth sciences. The rising demand for data integration, harmonized chronostratigraphic frameworks, and collaborative solutions to planetary-scale challenges, including climate archives and resource sustainability and calls for renewed global synergy. STRATI 2026 will act as a catalyst for these efforts, not only strengthening the traditional research in stratigraphy and high-resolution geochronology, but also leveraging advancements in open-access digital platforms that empower scientists worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suzhou, a city renowned for its harmonious blend of heritage and modernity, provides an ideal backdrop for this global dialogue. The Suzhou DDE Center embodies the spirit of international scientific collaboration. As a hub for open-data initiatives and interdisciplinary cooperation, it will serve as a dynamic venue for showcasing global innovations in stratigraphy and facilitating hands-on engagement with cutting-edge tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      We envision STRATI 2026 as a milestone in our collective progress. Over six days, participants will share knowledge through thematic sessions, workshops, and field excursions across iconic geological regions. We particularly encourage subcommissions, working groups, and early-career scientists to shape the program, ensuring that diverse perspectives inform the agenda. Together, we will explore how stratigraphy can bridge disciplinary divides, refine global standards and correlations, and illuminate Earth’s history with unprecedented clarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spirit of unity and discovery, we warmly invite researchers, educators, and policymakers worldwide. Let us seize this moment to forge partnerships that transcend borders and advance stratigraphy as a truly global endeavor. Join us in Suzhou to write the next chapter of our planet’s story—together.
