    <p>
      This 7-days&rsquo; excursion will examine several well-studied geological
      sections across the Ediacaran&ndash;Cambrian, Silurian&ndash;Devonian, and
      Permian&ndash;Triassic boundaries, and associated fossils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main geological sites include: 1) The Ediacaran&ndash;Cambrian
      boundary at Meishucun section, Jinning District, Kunming City, showing the
      abundant and diverse phosphatized small shelly fossils and trace fossils,
      as well as the earliest occurrence of trilobites and soft-bodied fossils.
      2) The UNESCO Natural Heritage fossil site, the early Cambrian Chengjiang
      fauna, and the Field Research Station of Nanjing Institute of Geology and
      Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, at Maotianshan, Chengjiang
      City, Yuxi City. 3) Sections across the Silurian&ndash;Devonian boundary
      and the famous early vertebrate fossil sites including the late Silurian
      Xiaoxiang fauna and Xitun fauna, as well as some early vascular land plant
      fossil sites in the vicinity of Qujing City. 4) Terrestrial
      Permian&ndash;Triassic sections at Taoshujing and Guanbachong, Zhaotong
      City, showing the transition from humid swamp to semiarid alluvial
      environments and the collapse of the tropical forest ecosystems across the
      Permian&ndash;Triassic&nbsp;boundary.

      The Xitun Fauna was world famous because of&nbsp;the diverse early
      vertebrates from Xitun Formation (Lochkovian, early Devonian) exposed at
      Xitun Village in Qujing City. These fish fossils&nbsp;have challenged the
      classical views on the origin and early evolutionary history of
      osteichthyans, and corroborated the hypothesis of South China being the
      center of origin and early diversification of sarcopterygians, such
      as&nbsp;the osteichthyans <em><em>Youngolepis</em></em

      This section, along a country road to a water reservoir, includes the
      middle&ndash;upper Permian Emeishan Basalts, upper Permian&ndash;Lower
      Triassic coal-bearing Xuanwei Formation, Lower Triassic Kayitou Formation,
      and Lower Triassic Dongchuan Formation. Diverse fossil plants of the
      Cathaysian flora, including lycophytes, ferns and seed-ferns (i.e.
      sphenophytes, pecopterids), gigantopterids, cycadophytes
      (<em>Pterophyllum</em>), and primitive ginkgophytes are common in the
      Xuanwei and Kayitou formations. Ash-beds are developed in the Xuanwei and
      Kayitou formations. Dongchuan Formation is a red-bed sequence.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      This section encompasses the same litho-units as those of the Guanbachong
      section, but with a much thicker Kayitou Formation. Fossil plants are
      commonly seen in the Xuanwei and Kayitou formations. Recently, a
      ~300-m-long drill core has been obtained from this section, assisting a
      better understanding of the palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatical
      changes across the critical Permian&ndash;Triassic transition. Relevant
      geochemical and geophysical studies are ongoing.

    </h3>
    <p>
      This excursion investigates the well-preserved successions of
      Carboniferous, Permian to early Triassic, including: the Late Paleozoic
      ice age (LPIA) at the Naqing section, and the Early Triassic
      lagerst&auml;tten of the Wangmo and Guiyang biotas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Naqing section, is located in Luodian County, southern Guizhou
      province, South China. It is represented by the platform margin to slope
      facies and contains continuous carbonate deposits from the Early
      Carboniferous to the Late Permian. Conodont fossils are abundant
      throughout the section, providing potential correlation with the global
      scale chronostratigraphic scheme. The basal boundary of four Carboniferous
      stages, namely the Serpukhovian, Moscovian, Kasimovian, and Gzhelian
      stages can be well defined by conodonts and foraminifers (fusulines) in
      the section. Meanwhile, through the geochemical studies on
      &delta;<sup>238</sup>U<sub>carb</sub>,
      &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>carb</sub>,
      and<sub>&nbsp;</sub>&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub>, two environmental
      events such as warming and expanded oceanic anoxia during the Late
      Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA) can be observed in this section, one of which
      occur at the end-Serpukhovian stage and another at the earliest Gzhelian
      stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      High-resolution cyclostratigraphy and sedimentology further enhance our
      understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of the South China Sea
      during the LPIA. The Naqing section offers a unique opportunity to refine
      the Carboniferous and Lower Permian timescales, study the evolution of
      Late Paleozoic conodonts, reconstruct paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic
      changes during the LPIA, and examine the bio-environment interactions
      during one of Earth's most extreme climatic periods.

      The exceptionally preserved lagerst&auml;tten have also been reported from
      the Wangmo county and Guiyang city, Guizhou Province, named as the Wangmo
      and Guiyang biotas. These exceptional fossils are yielded in the lower
      part of the Lower Triassic (i.e. 250.83 +0.07/ &ndash; 0.06 million years
      ago). The Guiyang biota comprises at least 12 classes and 19 orders,
      including diverse fish fauna and malacostracans, revealing a trophically
      complex marine ecosystem. Therefore, these early Triassic
      lagerst&auml;tten represent the oldest known Mesozoic biotas, marking the
      rapid rise of modern-type marine ecosystems after the Permian-Triassic
      mass extinction. The Wangmo biota is an another newly discovered early
      Triassic fossil Lagerst&auml;tte in Wangmo County, two hours driving from
      Guiyang. The fossils are exceptionally preserved in thin bedded mudstones
      and microcrystalline limestones of the Lower Triassic Luolou Formation.
      The fossil assemblages are dominated by ammonites and arthropods,
      accompanied by bivalves, belemnoids, brachiopods, conodonts, fishes,
      microconchids, and problematic fossils.

    <p>
      The Three George area, western Hubei Province, central China is not only
      famous with the spectacular landscapes sculptured by the Yangtze River and
      the greatest dam in the world, but also records one of the most continuous
      marine Late Neoproterozoic to Mesozoic successions in China, providing the
      classic book of Earth evolution for this period and displaying excellent
      stratigraphic and geologic records of several most important events
      characterizing the life-environment evolutions of Earth, including the
      Snowball Earth event, early animal evolution, Cambrian explosion
      (Qingjiang Lagerst&auml;tte), the Great Ordovician Biodiversification,
      end-Ordovician mass extinction, two GSSPs of stages within the Ordovician,
      middle-late Permian mass extinction, Permian-Triassic mass extinction, and
      Early Triassic hothouse regime.

    </p>
    <p>
      This 7-day excursion will examine Ediacaran succession that is
      characterized by Marinoan tillite, cap carbonate, black shale, and massive
      dolomite, and correlates well with their counterparts exposed elsewhere in
      China and the world. The well-known Marinoan Snowball Earth event and its
      aftermath as well as unique records of well-known multicellular Ediacaran
      biota (Shibantan Biota, including the first footprint of animal ever in
      Earth history) are also investigated in this route. The
      Precambrian-Cambrian transition is rather continuous and comprised of
      black shales containing abundant phosphorus sediments of industrial value.
      The Qingjiang Lagerst&auml;tte, equivalent to the Chengjiang Biota, from
      the Changyang county of Yichang City witnessed the Cambrian explosion in
      early Cambrian. The Lower Paleozoic successions are particularly
      continuous around the Yichang City and yield abundant invertebrate
      fossils. To date, at least two stage-level GSSPs of the Ordovician have
      been established in this area, and the Ordovician/Silurian (O/S) boundary
      mass extinction is also well recorded herein. The equivalent of black
      shale succession yielding huge sources of shale-gas in South China is also
      examined during this excursion. The Devonian to Lower Permian strata are
      locally exposed in the Three Gorge area. The middle Permian to Triassic
      successions are well exposed in the Xiaokou section of the Xingshan
      county, northern part of the Three Gorge area, displaying lithologic and
      biotic variations across the Guadalupian-Lopingian and Permian-Triassic
      mass extinctions. The Lower marine reptile Lagerst&auml;tte of the Yuanan
      Biota is also located in the north of Yichang City. The Middle-Upper
      Triassic successions are dominated by lacustrine facies sediments, while
      the Jurassic comprises fluvial facies conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone
      due to the uplift of the Three Gorge area since the Middle Triassic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complete and continuous successions of the Ediacaran to Triassic of
      this excursion offers you a better understanding of biotic and
      environmental evolution during the first half pace of Phanerozoic.
      Additionally, this field excursion provides a unique opportunity to enjoy
      the spectacular landscapes of the Three Gorges and great dam as well as
      local cultures of ancient Chu Kingdom in the central part of China.

        ><strong>The Yanliao and Jehol biotas in North China</strong></strong
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Mesozoic strata of western Liaoning, northern Hebei&nbsp;Province, and
      southeastern Inner Mongolia host the renowned Yanliao and Jehol Biotas,
      offering critical insights into terrestrial ecosystems during the middle
      to late Mesozoic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Yanliao Biota is widely distributed in Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia;
      Luanping and Qinglong in northern Hebei; and Lingyuan, Beipiao, Jianchang,
      and Jianping in western Liaoning. It can be subdivided into two
      assemblages: the Lower Assemblage, represented by the Daohugou Biota, with
      fossils preserved in the Haifanggou Formation (upper Middle Jurassic) in
      Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia, where numerous fossils of insects,
      branchiopods, salamanders, feathered dinosaurs, diverse mammals, and
      abundant plant fossils have been discovered; and the Upper Assemblage,
      represented by the Linglongta Biota, with fossils preserved in the
      Tiaojishan Formation (Middle to Upper Jurassic) in Jianchang, western
      Liaoning, where numerous fossils of insects, fishes, feathered dinosaurs,
      and pterosaurs have been found.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota is widely distributed in Beipiao and
      Lingyuan in western Liaoning, Weichang and Pingquan in northern Hebei, and
      Ningcheng in Inner Mongolia. It can be divided into three assemblages: the
      Lower Assemblage, mainly preserved in the Dabeigou Formation in northern
      Hebei, yielding numerous fossils of insects, branchiopods, fishes,
      salamanders, and birds; the Middle Assemblage, marking the zenith of the
      flourishing period of the Jehol Biota, centered in the Yanliao area and
      preserved in the Yixian Formation, characterized by abundant fossils of
      insects, fishes, pterosaurs, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, and plants, among
      which the <em><em>Confuciusornis</em></em
      >-rich layer has an absolute age of <em><em>ca</em></em
      >. 125 Ma; and the Upper Assemblage, represented by fossils preserved in
      the Jiufotang Formation in Lingyuan and Jianchang, western Liaoning,
      mainly including fishes, reptiles, and birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exceptionally preserved Yanliao Biota of the Middle-Late Jurassic and
      the Jehol Biota of the Early Cretaceous are located in core areas with
      developed volcanic rocks, and their fossil layers often have
      well-constrained chronologies. The fossils are exquisitely preserved and
      vast in number, serving as a treasure trove for understanding the
      evolution of terrestrial ecosystems during the Mesozoic.

        ><strong>Linxia Basin and Loess in North China</strong></strong
      >
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Linxia Basin is located at the triple junction of the northeastern
      Tibetan Plateau, the western Qinling Mountains, and the Loess Plateau,
      delineated by high-angle deep thrusts. The lateral extent of the Linxia
      Basin is marked by structural boundaries on the northern, western, and
      southern edges, but its eastern margin is poorly determined. The basin is
      filled with 700-2000 m of Cenozoic deposits, mainly red in color and
      dominated by lacustrine siltstones and mudstones punctuated by fluvial
      conglomerates or sandstones, and 30-200 m of Quaternary loess sediments.
      To the west and south, the major basin-bounding faults within the Tibetan
      Plateau are the Leijishan and North Qinling faults, respectively. The
      Cenozoic deposits of the Linxia Basin begin in the Eocene and lap over
      Cretaceous deposits in the Maxian Mountains to the north. Throughout the
      central part of the Linxia Basin, the oldest deposits were laid down
      unconformably on the granite of presumed Paleozoic age. To the southwest
      of the Linxia Basin, the Tibetan Plateau consists of Devonian-Permian
      terrestrial and marine deposits and Triassic submarine fan deposits, which
      were shed by the east-southeast striking Qinling Mountain belt to the east
      of the plateau.
    </p>

    <p class="text-center">
      An example of the Linxia Basin exposures is near the basin center looking
      toward the northwest, and these Cenozoic exposures are excellent and
      continuous, with many fossil-rich beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cenozoic sediments in the Linxia Basin are relatively stable, with
      strata close to horizontal and containing a large number of mammalian and
      other vertebrate fossils. It is not only an ideal area for studying the
      evolution of Cenozoic mammals, but also records important information such
      as the tectonic movement and climate change in the northeastern margin of
      the Tibetan Plateau. The localities in the Linxia Basin are notable for
      abundant, relatively complete, well-preserved, and sometimes partially
      articulated bones of large mammals, which often occur in dense
      concentrations. Many new species of the Late Oligocene

      The loess in China is renowned for its wide distribution range,
      continuity, complete stratigraphic development, and large thickness,
      forming the famous Loess Plateau. The Quaternary loess in the Linxia
      Basin, like the typical sequence of the Loess Plateau, includes the Early
      Pleistocene Wucheng Loess, the Middle Pleistocene Lishi Loess, and the
      Late Pleistocene Malan Loess. The loess strata contain multiple paleosol
      layers, indicating that the ancient climate during the formation of loess
      underwent multiple dry-cold and humid-warm changes. Through the study of
      loess, the changes in atmospheric circulation, the evolution of ancient
      climate and environment, and the processes of dust transport and
      accumulation can be revealed. Therefore, loess, along with ice cores and
      deep-sea sediments, are known as the &ldquo;three pillars&rdquo; of
      paleoclimatological research.

    <p>
      Marine Mesoproterozoic and Cambrian, and terrestrial Permian and Triassic
      successions are well exposed in the Yuntaishan, Dengfeng and Yiyang areas,
      respectively in Henan Province, central China. The Yuntai mountain
      consists mainly of Mesoproterozoic conglomerate, sandstone and mudstone of
      the Ruyang Group. The spectacular reddish sandstone landscapes sculptured
      by the local creeks not only attract publics and thus become one of the
      most attractive tourist hot spots in central China, but also provide a
      unique window investigating Mesoproterozoic environment and ecosystems.
      Here, reddish sandstone yields abundant microbially induced sedimentary
      structures (MISSs), and wrinkle structures, sandy cracks and microbial
      mats are particularly common. Acritarch microfossils have also extracted
      from the mudstone sediments of the Ruyang Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambrian successions are well exposed in the Dengfeng area, at which the
      famous Shaolin Temple of Chinese Kung Fu is located. The Cambrian strata
      are dominated by muddy limestones which are often highly bioturbated and
      yield abundant microbialites and giant ooids. Here we will examine
      substrate revolution of Cambrian where trace-making animals were
      associated with microbial ecosystems (microbial mats or ooids).
      Terrestrial Permian and Triassic successions are well exposed in many
      areas of Henan Province, while the Permian-Triassic boundary succession is
      best exposed in Yiyang area. Here, the uppermost Permian strata comprise
      greenish and black shale/mudstone and sandstone of floodplain facies of
      the lower Sunjiagou Formation, while the basal Triassic is characterized
      by massive reddish paleosols, sandstone and mudstone of the upper
      Sunjiagou Formation, followed by massive sandstone/conglomerates of the
      Liujiagou Formation, which indicates the sedimentation of fluvial facies.
      The lithological variations are distinct across the P-Tr boundary and also
      indicate pronounced climatic changes from warm-wet condition to arid-hot
      regime.

      microbial carbonates in Guilin area, Guangxi Province, South China
    </p>
    <p>
      The Guilin area of Guangxi Province, South China is famous for its
      spectacular carbonate karst landscapes and fantastic carbonate caves.
      Guilin, with diversified depositional facies, including restricted
      carbonate platform interior, open platform-platform margin, and marginal
      slope-basinal facies, locally rich in marine fauna (e.g., brachiopods,
      corals, bryozoans,bivalves, trilobites, conodonts and ostracods), is one
      of the potential areas suitable for neritic-pelagic correlation of the
      Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous succession. Herein, the cone-shaped
      hills consist of Upper Devonian carbonates, which usually develop platform
      facies metazoan reefs (i.e. sponge and coral reefs) of Frasnian and
      microbialites of Famennian, witnessing biosedimentary changes from the
      metazoan-dominated reef systems to microbial reefs across the
      Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) mass extinction on shallow platforms.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      The continuous F-F boundary is recorded at the Yangdi and Baisha sections,
      representing the restricted platform and intraplatform basin facies,
      respectively. In Yangdi the F-F succession comprises the Xiangtian and
      Wuzhishan formations. The former is composed of grey to dark grey
      brecciated limestone, muddy limestone, nodular limestone, while the
      overlying Wuzhishan Formation comprises light grey nodular limestone. The
      Baisha section records relatively deeper successions of the F-F boundary,
      which are dominated by thin-bedded laminated muddy limestone of the Gubi
      Formation at the lower part of the section, while the upper part also
      consists of the Wuzhishan Formation (Zhao et al., 2024).The
      Famennian-Tournaisian (also Devonian-Carboniferous) boundary succession is
      recorded in the north of Guilin, the Nanbiancun section, which has been
      recommended by the International Working Group of D/C Boundary as an
      auxiliary stratotype of the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary in 1989.
      Besides, GSSP for the base of the Visean Stage has been established in the
      Pengchong section, Liuzhou, which is near the Guilin City.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this field excursion, you will not only have some basic knowledge
      of typical Chinese Devonian and Lower Carboniferous in terms of
      stratigraphy and sedimentology, but also enjoy the spectacular karstic
      scenery around Guilin area.

      The Meishan sections, recognized as the most intensively studied
      geological site in the world, feature the unique Changhsingian body
      stratotype defined by two Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points
      (GSSPs). These sections capture the entire process of the end-Permian mass
      extinction and serve as a cornerstone for understanding Earth's history in
      both scientific and popular contexts. To highlight its significance, a
      geopark and two exceptional paleontological and GSSP museums have been
      established at the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Meishan Geopark offers a rich repository for exploring the
      Permian-Triassic world, the GSSPs, volcanic ash layers, the history of the
      largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic, and the local culture. The
      Meishan Museums provide a vivid depiction of Earth's life history,
      showcasing a diverse array of fossils, minerals, and the contributions of
      prominent Chinese and international scientists who have studied the
      Meishan sections. This site has become a premier destination for students
      across China and plays a crucial role in promoting geoscientific knowledge
      and environmental awareness to the public. Additionally, it fosters

      2.&nbsp;<strong><strong>Tai Lake Xishan Section</strong></strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;The Xishan section is located on the Xishan Island in Tai Lake in
      Jiangsu Province, South China. During the Permian-Triassic transition, the
      South China Block was located in the eastern Palaeo-Tethys near the
      equator, where shallow platforms were widespread and separated by numerous
      deep intra-platform basins or troughs. The section is composed of the
      uppermost Permian and the lowermost Triassic strata. The uppermost Permian
      succession (Changxing Formation) is a set of 179 m-thick limestone
      accumulated on the carbonate platform. These limestones mainly comprise
      thick- to very thick-bedded bioclastic grainstone/packstone with sponge
      reef/mound interbeddings. Overlying the grainstone/packstone-reef/mound
      complex is a set of 9 m-thick thin- to medium-bedded calcareous algae
      wackestone/packstone. Fossils in the Permian Changxing Formation are
      abundant and diverse, including calcareous algae, calcareous sponges,
      bryozoans, crinoids, fusulinids, small foraminifers, gastropods,
      brachiopods, and ostracods. The lowermost Triassic succession (Yinkeng
      Formation) is a 14-m-thick deep-shelf mixed carbonate-siliciclastic
      sequence, consisting of grayish green and grayish black mudstone with very
      thin- to thin-bedded dolomite interbeddings. Fossils are sparse, dominated
      by brachiopods, gastropods, and echinoderm clasts of Permian types, with
      occasional Triassic-type bivalve shell beds. The abrupt decrease of fossil
      diversity and abundance at the boundary between the Changxing and the
      Yinkeng formations indicates the Permian-Triassic event boundary (or the
      maximum mass extinction horizon).

    <p class="text-center">The Permian-Triassic boundary interval at Xishan, Suzhou</p>
    <p>
      The basal 2-m-thick layer of the Yingkeng Formation is a dolostone crust.
      It is in this stratigraphic interval we discovered carbonate concretions
      approximately 10 cm across with fabrics and fossils associated with
      microbialites. The microbialite-associated structures in these concretions
      include clotted fabrics and laminated carbonate needles, as well as
      abundant carbonate crystal fans. Fossil groups associated with
      microbialite include microconchids, small gastropods, and small
      foraminifers. On the basis of the analysis of the microfabrics and the
      fossil groups together with a comparison to modern analogues, we attribute
      the formation of the micritic patches in the microbialite concretions to
      the calcification of cyanobacterial mats via carbonate nanoparticles and
      we attribute the carbonate crystal fans to the direct recrystallization of
      micritic carbonates. The sparitic patches were interpreted as either the
      direct recrystallization of micritic carbonates or the precipitation of
      carbonate spars in the inter-/intra-spaces of metazoan shells together
      with the recrystallization of these shells. The similarities to modern
      stromatolites, both in morphology and in internal texture, suggest that
      the laminated carbonate needles are stromatolite laminae built by
      filamentous cyanobacteria. The preservation of these microbialite
      microfabrics indicates that early lithification by carbonate precipitation
      was widespread and intense following the end-Permian boundary events. The
      weak development of microbialites as small concretions may be attributed
      to the deeper water depth and the lower water energy in the Xishan area
      during the earliest Triassic.

      The Hanggai section in Anji, Northwestern Zhejiang Province, was ratified
      as the &ldquo;Reference Section of the Hirnantian Stage for Lower Yangtze
      Region, South China&rdquo;. The section exposes continuous Upper Katian to
      Rhuddanian interval of graptolitic shale and fine grain clastics deposits,
      in which the Hirnantian Stage is ca. 360 m thick (Wenchang Formation). The
      section contains fairly diverse fossils, including abundant graptolites,
      chitinozoans, and sponges, and less abundant brachiopods, trilobites and
      gastropods, etc. Biostratigraphically, six successive graptolite biozones
      and a benthic assemblage are identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Anji Biota reported here is a unique deposit with exceptionally
      preserved sponges and other organisms in deep-water, uppermost Ordovician
      mudstone. The sponge fossils preserve remarkable details
      including&nbsp;carbonaceous preservation of soft tissues and axial
      filaments of spicules. The discovery of Anji Biota, dominated by abundant
