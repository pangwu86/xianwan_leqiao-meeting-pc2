    3.&nbsp;<strong
      ><strong>The Yanliao and Jehol biotas in North China</strong></strong
    >
  </h3>
  <p>
    The Mesozoic strata of western Liaoning, northern Hebei&nbsp;Province, and
    southeastern Inner Mongolia host the renowned Yanliao and Jehol Biotas,
    offering critical insights into terrestrial ecosystems during the middle to
    late Mesozoic.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Yanliao Biota is widely distributed in Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia;
    Luanping and Qinglong in northern Hebei; and Lingyuan, Beipiao, Jianchang,
    and Jianping in western Liaoning. It can be subdivided into two assemblages:
    the Lower Assemblage, represented by the Daohugou Biota, with fossils
    preserved in the Haifanggou Formation (upper Middle Jurassic) in Ningcheng,
    Inner Mongolia, where numerous fossils of insects, branchiopods,
    salamanders, feathered dinosaurs, diverse mammals, and abundant plant
    fossils have been discovered; and the Upper Assemblage, represented by the
    Linglongta Biota, with fossils preserved in the Tiaojishan Formation (Middle
    to Upper Jurassic) in Jianchang, western Liaoning, where numerous fossils of
    insects, fishes, feathered dinosaurs, and pterosaurs have been found.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota is widely distributed in Beipiao and
    Lingyuan in western Liaoning, Weichang and Pingquan in northern Hebei, and
    Ningcheng in Inner Mongolia. It can be divided into three assemblages: the
    Lower Assemblage, mainly preserved in the Dabeigou Formation in northern
    Hebei, yielding numerous fossils of insects, branchiopods, fishes,
    salamanders, and birds; the Middle Assemblage, marking the zenith of the
    flourishing period of the Jehol Biota, centered in the Yanliao area and
    preserved in the Yixian Formation, characterized by abundant fossils of
    insects, fishes, pterosaurs, dinosaurs, birds, mammals, and plants, among
    which the <em><em>Confuciusornis</em></em
    >-rich layer has an absolute age of <em><em>ca</em></em
    >. 125 Ma; and the Upper Assemblage, represented by fossils preserved in the
    Jiufotang Formation in Lingyuan and Jianchang, western Liaoning, mainly
    including fishes, reptiles, and birds.
  </p>
  <p>
    The exceptionally preserved Yanliao Biota of the Middle-Late Jurassic and
    the Jehol Biota of the Early Cretaceous are located in core areas with
    developed volcanic rocks, and their fossil layers often have
    well-constrained chronologies. The fossils are exquisitely preserved and
    vast in number, serving as a treasure trove for understanding the evolution
    of terrestrial ecosystems during the Mesozoic.
