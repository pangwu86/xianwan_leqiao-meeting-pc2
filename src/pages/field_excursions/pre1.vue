    <h3>
      1.&nbsp;<strong>Critical stratigraphic boundary intervals in Yunnan&nbsp;Province
      , SW China</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This 7-days&rsquo; excursion will examine several well-studied geological
      sections across the Ediacaran&ndash;Cambrian, Silurian&ndash;Devonian, and
      Permian&ndash;Triassic boundaries, and associated fossils.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main geological sites include: 1) The Ediacaran&ndash;Cambrian
      boundary at Meishucun section, Jinning District, Kunming City, showing the
      abundant and diverse phosphatized small shelly fossils and trace fossils,
      as well as the earliest occurrence of trilobites and soft-bodied fossils.
      2) The UNESCO Natural Heritage fossil site, the early Cambrian Chengjiang
      fauna, and the Field Research Station of Nanjing Institute of Geology and
      Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, at Maotianshan, Chengjiang
      City, Yuxi City. 3) Sections across the Silurian&ndash;Devonian boundary
      and the famous early vertebrate fossil sites including the late Silurian
      Xiaoxiang fauna and Xitun fauna, as well as some early vascular land plant
      fossil sites in the vicinity of Qujing City. 4) Terrestrial
      Permian&ndash;Triassic sections at Taoshujing and Guanbachong, Zhaotong
      City, showing the transition from humid swamp to semiarid alluvial
      environments and the collapse of the tropical forest ecosystems across the
      Permian&ndash;Triassic&nbsp;boundary.

    </p>
    <p>
      Lots of early vertebrates&nbsp;from Xiaoxiang&nbsp;Fauna hold an important
      and critical position in the evolutionary history from fishes to human
      beings, such as the eugaleaspid <em>Dunyu longiforus, the </em>placoderms<em> Entelognathus primordialis, Qilinyu rostrate, </em>and<em> &ldquo;Wangolepis sinensis&rdquo;, osteichthyans Guiyu oneiros, Megamastax amblyodus&nbsp;</em>and<em> Sparalepis tingi </em>, as well as new material
      awaiting study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lunch Break, Bus from Xiaoxiang fossil site to S/D boundary:

    </p>
    <p>
      The Xitun Fauna was world famous because of&nbsp;the diverse early
      vertebrates from Xitun Formation (Lochkovian, early Devonian) exposed at
      Xitun Village in Qujing City. These fish fossils&nbsp;have challenged the
      classical views on the origin and early evolutionary history of
      osteichthyans, and corroborated the hypothesis of South China being the
      center of origin and early diversification of sarcopterygians, such
      as&nbsp;the osteichthyans <em>Youngolepis, Diabolepis, Psarolepis, Achoania, Meemannia
      , </em>and<em> Styloichthys</em>
    </p>

      Devonian) and three-dimensional reconstruction fish models, such as
      Onychodon and Antiarchs, were exhibited in the museum and workstation.
    </p>

    <p><em>Stop 9: Guanbachong section. 9:30&ndash;12:00.</em></p>
    <p>
      This section, along a country road to a water reservoir, includes the
      middle&ndash;upper Permian Emeishan Basalts, upper Permian&ndash;Lower
      Triassic coal-bearing Xuanwei Formation, Lower Triassic Kayitou Formation,
      and Lower Triassic Dongchuan Formation. Diverse fossil plants of the
      Cathaysian flora, including lycophytes, ferns and seed-ferns (i.e.
      sphenophytes, pecopterids), gigantopterids, cycadophytes
      (<em>Pterophyllum</em>), and primitive ginkgophytes are common in the
      Xuanwei and Kayitou formations. Ash-beds are developed in the Xuanwei and
      Kayitou formations. Dongchuan Formation is a red-bed sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bus from Guanbachong section to Taoshujing section: 12:00&ndash;12:30.
    </p>
    <p><em>Stop 10: Taoshujing section. 13:30&ndash;15:30.</em></p>
    <p>
      This section encompasses the same litho-units as those of the Guanbachong
      section, but with a much thicker Kayitou Formation. Fossil plants are
      commonly seen in the Xuanwei and Kayitou formations. Recently, a
      ~300-m-long drill core has been obtained from this section, assisting a
      better understanding of the palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatical
      changes across the critical Permian&ndash;Triassic transition. Relevant
      geochemical and geophysical studies are ongoing.
