        Late Paleozoic to earliest Mesozoic stratigraphy and faunas in Guizhou,
        South China

  </h3>
  <p>
    This excursion investigates the well-preserved successions of Carboniferous,
    Permian to early Triassic, including: the Late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA) at
    the Naqing section, and the Early Triassic lagerst&auml;tten of the Wangmo
    and Guiyang biotas.

  <p>
    The Naqing section, is located in Luodian County, southern Guizhou province,
    South China. It is represented by the platform margin to slope facies and
    contains continuous carbonate deposits from the Early Carboniferous to the
    Late Permian. Conodont fossils are abundant throughout the section,
    providing potential correlation with the global scale chronostratigraphic
    scheme. The basal boundary of four Carboniferous stages, namely the
    Serpukhovian, Moscovian, Kasimovian, and Gzhelian stages can be well defined
    by conodonts and foraminifers (fusulines) in the section. Meanwhile, through
    the geochemical studies on &delta;<sup>238</sup>U<sub>carb</sub>,
    &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>carb</sub>,
    and<sub>&nbsp;</sub>&delta;<sup>18</sup>O<sub>PO4</sub>, two environmental
    events such as warming and expanded oceanic anoxia during the Late Paleozoic
    Ice Age (LPIA) can be observed in this section, one of which occur at the
    end-Serpukhovian stage and another at the earliest Gzhelian stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    High-resolution cyclostratigraphy and sedimentology further enhance our
    understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of the South China Sea
    during the LPIA. The Naqing section offers a unique opportunity to refine
    the Carboniferous and Lower Permian timescales, study the evolution of Late
    Paleozoic conodonts, reconstruct paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic
    changes during the LPIA, and examine the bio-environment interactions during
    one of Earth's most extreme climatic periods.

    The exceptionally preserved lagerst&auml;tten have also been reported from
    the Wangmo county and Guiyang city, Guizhou Province, named as the Wangmo
    and Guiyang biotas. These exceptional fossils are yielded in the lower part
    of the Lower Triassic (i.e. 250.83 +0.07/ &ndash; 0.06 million years ago).
    The Guiyang biota comprises at least 12 classes and 19 orders, including
    diverse fish fauna and malacostracans, revealing a trophically complex
    marine ecosystem. Therefore, these early Triassic lagerst&auml;tten
    represent the oldest known Mesozoic biotas, marking the rapid rise of
    modern-type marine ecosystems after the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.
    The Wangmo biota is an another newly discovered early Triassic fossil
    Lagerst&auml;tte in Wangmo County, two hours driving from Guiyang. The
    fossils are exceptionally preserved in thin bedded mudstones and
    microcrystalline limestones of the Lower Triassic Luolou Formation. The
    fossil assemblages are dominated by ammonites and arthropods, accompanied by
    bivalves, belemnoids, brachiopods, conodonts, fishes, microconchids, and
    problematic fossils.
