    <h3>1.&nbsp;<strong>Meishan section and Meishan Geopark </strong></h3>
    <p>
      The Meishan sections, recognized as the most intensively studied
      geological site in the world, feature the unique Changhsingian body
      stratotype defined by two Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points
      (GSSPs). These sections capture the entire process of the end-Permian mass
      extinction and serve as a cornerstone for understanding Earth's history in
      both scientific and popular contexts. To highlight its significance, a
      geopark and two exceptional paleontological and GSSP museums have been
      established at the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Meishan Geopark offers a rich repository for exploring the
      Permian-Triassic world, the GSSPs, volcanic ash layers, the history of the
      largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic, and the local culture. The
      Meishan Museums provide a vivid depiction of Earth's life history,
      showcasing a diverse array of fossils, minerals, and the contributions of
      prominent Chinese and international scientists who have studied the
      Meishan sections. This site has become a premier destination for students
      across China and plays a crucial role in promoting geoscientific knowledge
      and environmental awareness to the public. Additionally, it fosters
      international scientific research and collaboration.
