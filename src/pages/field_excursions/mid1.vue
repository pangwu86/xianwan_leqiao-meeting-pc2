  </h3>
  <p>
    The Meishan sections, recognized as the most intensively studied geological
    site in the world, feature the unique Changhsingian body stratotype defined
    by two Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs). These
    sections capture the entire process of the end-Permian mass extinction and
    serve as a cornerstone for understanding Earth's history in both scientific
    and popular contexts. To highlight its significance, a geopark and two
    exceptional paleontological and GSSP museums have been established at the
    site.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Meishan Geopark offers a rich repository for exploring the
    Permian-Triassic world, the GSSPs, volcanic ash layers, the history of the
    largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic, and the local culture. The
    Meishan Museums provide a vivid depiction of Earth's life history,
    showcasing a diverse array of fossils, minerals, and the contributions of
    prominent Chinese and international scientists who have studied the Meishan
    sections. This site has become a premier destination for students across
    China and plays a crucial role in promoting geoscientific knowledge and
    environmental awareness to the public. Additionally, it fosters
    international scientific research and collaboration.
