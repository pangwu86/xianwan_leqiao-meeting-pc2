  <p>
    The relatively complete Mesoproterozoic successions were deposited in some
    rift and post-rift basins in the North China Craton in the course of
    tectonic evolution from the break-up of Columbia to the assembly of Rodinia
    during the Mesoproterozoic times. The entire Mesoproterozoic succession is
    composed of the Changcheng and Jixian Groups. The former includes the
    Tuanshanzi, Dahongyu, and Gaoyuzhuang Formations, while the Jixian Group
    comprises the Yangzhuang, Wumishan, Hongshuizhuang, and Tieling Formations.
    The overlying Xiamaling Formation is assigned to Tonian in age.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Mesoproterozoic successions (~6.4 Ga-1.4 Ga) are best exposed in the
    Jixian area, which was situated the northeastern margins of the North China
    Craton. This 2-day excursion will examine the Changzhougou, Chuanlinggou,
    Tuanshanzi, Dahongyu, Gaoyuzhuang, Yangzhuang, Wumishan, Hongshuizhuang,
    Tieling, and Xiamaling formations in ascending order. Of these, the first
    confirmed eukaryotes from the Gaoyuzhuang Formation (Miao et al., 2024),
    mini-digital stromatolites from the Wumishan Formation, and spectacular
    giant stromatolites from the Tieling Formation are most important
    attractions in this route.

    This 2-day excursion offers you a better understanding of biotic and
    environmental evolutions during the Mesoproterozoic and a unique opportunity
    to enjoy local cultures of North China.
